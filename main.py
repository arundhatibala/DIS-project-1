•	This is the main entry point for your pipeline. This script will combine everything:
	•	Load the data.
	•	Preprocess it.
	•	Generate embeddings.
	•	Train the ranking model.
	•	Perform retrieval for the test queries.
	•	Evaluate the model’s performance.
The main.py script should be well-structured to call functions from the src/ modules and execute the project pipeline in a clean, readable way.
